COVID-19 has brought the world to a crawl, and as I prepare to graduate, I find myself with a surprising amount of free time on my hands.
I have been busy enough with a handful of quarantine resolutions (much more effective than new year's resolutions) such as running, learning [Swim to the Moon](), and *finally* getting this blog set up.
However, I need a project to work on -- something to really motivate me and keep my skills up.

Given my experience with programming languages and compilers, it would make sense for me to work on something in a similar vein.
Still, I don't want to reinvent the wheel with languages, and don't have any particularly groundbreaking ideas with related to programming languages at the moment that wouldn't be a massive time sink.
However, I do have a language that I have wanted to make obsolete for two years: LaTeX.

## Why reinvent LaTeX?

Two years ago, I began writing all of my school related documents in LaTeX.
Part of this was because, as a math student, everyone else knew LaTeX and wrote their documents in it, and part was because the documents produced in the end were *gorgeous*.
Still, while the end result was fantastic, there were some absolute warts in the process of actually making the documents.

1. Overly verbose and inconsistent syntax

1. Poor error messaging

1. Packaging conflicts and issues
