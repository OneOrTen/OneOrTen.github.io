COVID-19 has brought the world to a crawl, and as I prepare to graduate, I find myself with a surprising amount of free time on my hands.
I have been busy enough with a handful of quarantine resolutions (much more effective than new year's resolutions) such as running, learning [Swim to the Moon](), and *finally* getting this blog set up.
However, I need a *project* to work on -- something to really motivate me and keep my skills up.
